# Background

As a traveler, sometimes we need to see the preview of that place so we can decide whether to go there or maybe look for the other place.

# Solution

The Crevel app is one of the solution as it shows the preview of the travel destinations with images and stories at the particular destination.

In this app, user should able to:

- Search destinations
- Filter destination by tag
- See the current viral destinations
- See detail information of selected destination
- Additional information in story image form on each destination‚Äôs detail page
